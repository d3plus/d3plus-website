  <p>
    D3plus was built for a specific project - <a href="http://dataviva.info">dataviva.info</a> and as such does not contain every possible visualization imagined. We are hoping to continue expanding D3plus' set of capabilities, but to truly make it a useful tool we will need help from the rest of the community. We hope that many of you in this workshop will use D3plus for your next web based visualization project and <a href="https://github.com/alexandersimoes/d3plus/issues">submit bugs</a> to us!
  </p>
  <h3>On the ToDo List:</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make it faster! Optimize.</li>
      <li>Create a universal circle drawing class (used in many visualizations)</li>
      <li>Create a more generalized "chart" visualization that would house the stacked, pie scatter and lead to the possibility of a bar and line chart.</li>
      <li>Improved calling structure, abstract away the requirement of needing to re-call the visualization on the container element every time an attribute is changed.</li>
      <li>Create a "group" class to allow all visualizations created within a group to listen for the same events and update together</li>
      <li>Continue work on documentation</li>
      <li>Create more examples</li>
    </ul>

    As previously mentioned we hope that all of you go home after this workshop and fork D3plus with your own improvements and submit us tons and tons of pull requests. If you feel intimidated or think D3plus is fine as it is, you could also help us with documentation. We are doing our best to update the <a href="https://github.com/alexandersimoes/d3plus/wiki">wiki</a> but there are certainly holes. We've also created a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/d3plus">D3plus google group</a> as a direct line to the developers and other community members.
