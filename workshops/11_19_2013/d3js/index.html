<h2 class="bar">What is D3?</h2>
<section>
  <p>
    "D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation." - <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3js.org</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    D3plus is a library built to take advantage of the robust featureset of D3, while providing a fairly low barrier of entry to users new to code, design, and/or data visualization.

<h2 class="bar">How much D3 do I need to know?</h2>
<section>
  <p>
    Not a lot. One of the goals of D3plus is to handle as much of the work as possible, so there are only a few concepts you need to know to get started.

    <h3>Selecting a DOM element</h3>
    <div class="note">
      <p><code>d3.select()</code> will select a DOM element based on standard selector strings. In this example, we are creating a D3js element from a DIV with an ID of "container". You can read more about D3 selections <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#wiki-d3_select" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Calling a function on a D3 element</h3>
    <div class="note">
      <p><code>.call()</code> will invoke a specific function on a D3 selection. In this example, we are using the "call" ability to change the ID of our container DIV from "container" to "visualization". You can read more about the D3 call attribute <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#wiki-call" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
